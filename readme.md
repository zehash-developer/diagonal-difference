Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

For example, the square matrix arr is shown below:

1 2 3
4 5 6
9 8 9

The left-to-right diagonal is = 1 + 5 + 9 = 15

The right-to-left diagonal is = 3 + 5 + 9 = 17

Their absolute difference is = |15 - 17| = 2

# Function description

Complete the diagonalDifference function in the editor below.

diagonalDifference takes the following parameter:

int arr[n][m]: an array of integers

# Return

int: the absolute diagonal difference

#Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, n , the number of rows and columns in the square matrix arr

Each of the next n lines describes a row, arr[i] , and consists of n space-separated integers arr[i][j].

# Constraints

-100 <= arr[i][j] <= 100

# Output Format

Return the absolute difference between the sums of the matrix's two diagonals as a single integer.
